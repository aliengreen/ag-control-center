### How to create icns files ?

If you want to change application logo just overwrite existing `logo/logo.png` file with new one. Please, make sure image size should be 1024x1024 square.

Here's a script `create_icns.sh` to convert a 1024x1024 png (named `logo.png`) to the required icns file. Run script from terminal window:

`$ ./create_icns.sh` 

New icns file will be generated in `logo` folder with file name `icon.icns`.
